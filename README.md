MarbleDungeon
=============

A one level marble rolling game for Android that works on Nexus 7.

This project is the result of a 10 day "sprint" challenge to build an Android application 
that would work on the Nexus 7 tablet and utilize the device's sensors to "roll a marble" 
around the screen in some manner of game. My team chose to make a single level game board
where the player tips the device in order to roll the marble through a series of obstacles 
and enemies to reach a "goal" on the other side of the screen. 

Media such as music tracks, sprite drawings, and other images are cited where used in the source code. 

Programming by Kevin Goehring, Alishan Hasaan, and Nikhil Padmanabhan. 

Known bugs: The high scores are being saved and recorded twice if the player achieves a high score. 

Future work: The LevelOne.java file contains "too much" code/methods that should be designated elsewhere 
and called when needed. This will prevent reuse of code on any future levels that are designed.
